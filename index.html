	<!--This is my chance to show off my prized possession-->
	<h1>Just a little bit about my boy!</h1>
	<h2>My little boy is a corgi/chihuahua! This summer he will be 3 years old! </h2>
	<h3 style="color:darkgreen"> His name is Ryder, I had chose this name for him because it was one of my choices and then I saw a moving truck one day with the brand name Ryder, so I just said welp that's his name now!</h3>
	<p>Ryder and I spend every waking second with each other. We eat together, we take naps together, we go on adventures together, and so much more! I truly do not know where I would be without <b>Ryder.</b></p>
